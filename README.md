# Machine Learning with Matlab

Repository for my school assignments done with Matlab.
Contains also data files used by the code.

Naive_Bayes_model.m is part of exercise where insturctions are to build a
classifier using ???male_and_female.mat??? data. Compare the results to output of
???Naive_bayes_classifier.m???, which can be found in code folder (not included).
Comparison code is included in Naive_Bayes_model.m under function
Naive_bayes_classifier.

Fisher_goodness_of_features.m checks if some of the features could be removed. It uses fisher discriminant ratio to evaluate which feature is least usable for classification and tries if classification is as accurate with only two remaining features as it was with three features.
